- [x] **Task 1**\
&nbsp;   Build abstraction for nodes
- [x] **Task 2**\
&nbsp;  Theme based styling
- [x] **Task 3**\
&nbsp;  Adding handles dynamically, corresponding to variables in textarea
- [ ] **Task 4**\
&nbsp; Send pipeline data to backend and check if DAG( direct acyclic graph) exists and send it as response

## Issues
1. In **Task 3** new handles are added but are not functional.

2. Sending data using **FastAPI** and testing for **DAG**

3. Tried to add extra functionalities like
    - [ ] ability to delete all nodes
    - [ ] delete edges
    - [x] delete node\
lot to learn in reactflow
